The landing page is at [here][scam]. **WARNING: Do not submit your credit card infromation.**

### Fake Famous

One way to trick victim is to make the offer is so famous that it appear on your country's news. On this landing page, I notice there is one "AS SEEN ON" section which display my country's newspaper publishers.

After open the image in new tab, I notice the scammer use country specific "AS SEEN ON" images. So there are several **fake famous** images as following:

##### Singapore

### Fake Expire Date

One tactic I notice is the expired date of the **offer**, which is dynamically generate via JavaScript, thus the expired date is always next day. This make the victim fall in the trick to get the offer before expired.
